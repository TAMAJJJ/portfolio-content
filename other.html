        <p>The Garden of Words (Japanese: 言の葉の庭, Hepburn: Kotonoha no Niwa) is a 2013 Japanese anime drama film written, directed
        and edited by Makoto Shinkai, animated by CoMix Wave Films and distributed by Toho. It stars Miyu Irino and Kana
        Hanazawa, and features music by Daisuke Kashiwa instead of Tenmon, who had composed the music for many of Shinkai's
        previous films. The theme song, "Rain", was originally written and performed by Senri Oe in 1988, but was remade for the
        film and was sung by Motohiro Hata. The film was made into a manga, with illustrations by Midori Motohashi, and later
        novelized by Shinkai, both in the same year as the film.</p>
