        and Mone Kamishiraishi, with animation direction by Masashi Ando, character design by Masayoshi Tanaka, and its
        orchestral score and soundtrack composed by Radwimps. A light novel of the same name, also written by Shinkai, was
        published a month prior to the film's premiere.</p>
